    Lisbon’s participatory budgeting law allows citizens to propose and subsequently vote on potential line items in the City of Lisbon’s budget. Proposals are solicited across thirteen thematic areas covering science, culture, agriculture, and education, and citizens are invited to participate both through physical meetings and an online web portal. After the submission period has elapsed, government officials conduct a review of the submissions, combining similar ones and ultimately selecting the most meritorious to be put to a final public vote.

    capture citizen petitions for the constitution. The mayor created a working group
    to draft the constitution, consisting of academics, activists, former mayors,
    and other citizens representing a diverse cross-section of the population. Petitions
    that received 10,000 signatures were presented to representatives of the working
    group. Petitions that exceeded 50,000 signatures were presented directly to the
    mayor, who committed to including them in a draft of the constitution for approval
    by the constitutional assembly. Citizens submitted 341 proposals, receiving over
    400,000 votes. Four petitions surpassed the 50,000-signature threshold and 11
    received 10,000 signatures. The new constitution, which goes into effect in September
    2018, will include 14 articles based on citizen petitions.

    The pilot included 10 schools. Students collected data about their local school
    environments, reporting the major issues they faced, identifying the root causes
    of those issues, and proposing ideas to fix them. They identified over 600 issues
    ranging from burnt out light bulbs to missing fire extinguishers and broken chairs.
    The CGDF compiled the issues identified into a report detailing the findings,
    which they later presented to the department of education. The comptroller-general

    to oversee if the issues were resolved.

    We the Citizens was created to test whether a citizens’ assembly might be an effective public participation mechanism in Ireland. The program had three key components: a series of regional meetings, a trial Citizens Assembly, and a comprehensive survey to identify citizens’ views and opinions regarding the participation process. Citizens wishing to participate in the regional meetings could indicate their interest by signing up online. Regional meetings offered a number of general themes to provide a starting point for group discussions, but otherwise left space for participants to discuss matters most important to them. The Citizens Assembly was also focused on specific issues rather than general themes; participants were provided with briefing documents, and then asked to propose recommendations after engaging in group deliberation. No results were binding.

    This Tuscany law was designed through a meta-participatory process in which local stakeholders (e.g. authorities, interest groups, associations, academics, citizens) helped to define the content, features, and goals of the law -- all culminating in a “21st Century Town Meeting.” The law focused not on processes of participation, but that institutions promote “methodological pluralism” for engaging the public in public policies. The law is a prime example of institutionalizing crowdlaw practices and is the first law in the world passed at the regional level to proactively promote citizen engagement.
