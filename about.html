                <h2>About CrowdLaw</h2>

                <p>CrowdLaw is the simple but powerful idea that parliaments, city councils and public institutions work better when they encourage citizen engagement, leveraging new technologies to tap into diverse sources of opinions, expertise and data at each stage of the law and policymaking cycle to improve the quality and effectiveness of the resulting laws and policies.</p>

                <p>CrowdLaw is any law or policymaking process that offers a meaningful opportunity for the public to participate in one or multiples stages of decision-making, including but not limited to the processes of problem identification, solution identification, proposal drafting, ratification, implementation or evaluation. Through such processes, the public becomes collaborators and co-creators in public decision making.</p>

                <p>For more about CrowdLaw, see crowd.law. To sign up for the CrowdLaw Quarterly newsletter, <a href="https://thegovlab.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1a990feb5c&id=806638238e" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

                <h2>About the CrowdLaw Catalog</h2>

                <p>The CrowdLaw Catalog is a growing repository of 100 CrowdLaw cases from around the world. The goal of the catalog is to help those wishing to start new or improve existing CrowdLaw projects to learn from one another.</p>

                <p>Examples are tagged and searchable by four criteria:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Level</b> - What level of government is involved? Search by National, Regional, and/or Local</li>
                    <li><b>Stage</b> - At what stage of the law or policymaking process the participation take place? Search by Problem Identification, Solution Identification, Drafting, Decision Making, Implementation and/or Assessment</li>
                    <li><b>Task</b> -  What are people being asked to contribute? Search by: Ideas, Expertise, Opinions, Evidence and/or Actions.</li>
                    <li><b>Technology</b> - What is the platform? Search by: Web, Mobile and/or Offline</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The catalog offers brief descriptions of each initiative and links to additional resources.</p>

                <p>Coming Fall 2018, look out for the CrowdLaw Cases and the CrowdLaw Playbook - In-depth cases and instructions for how to start, run, maintain and measure a CrowdLaw project.</p>
